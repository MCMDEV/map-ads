# FAQ

### Can I sync the ads on multiple servers?

Not really, the plugin was not designed for that. If you are in need of this feature you can request it on my Discord server.

### Where do I report bugs / request features / ask questions?

On my Discord server. Please note that I will only give support to purchasers of the plugin. You can still file bug reports / feature requests without purchasing the plugin.
